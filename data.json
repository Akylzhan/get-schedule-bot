The state of the art and future challenges of q.-technologies will be illustrated with recent examples, such as extremely fast q.-computers, extremely precise q.-clocks, and extremely secure q.-communication lines. The course will conclude with brief discussion of our expectations for q.-technologies, public perceptions and market needs.","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Fall 2020","RNO":"349","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"3841","ABBR":"EDUC 709","TITLE":"Introduction to Scholarship in Education","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"421","SCHOOL":"Graduate School of Education","SCHOOLABBR":"GSE","SCHOOLID":"7","DEPARTMENT":"GSE","SHORTDESC":"The primary purpose of this course is to offer students who enter the Graduate School of Education doctoral program one common course that introduces them to becoming a scholar and a member of the academic community.","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Graduate: PhD","ACADEMICLEVELID":"3","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Fall 2019","RNO":"350","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"508","ABBR":"SOC 101","TITLE":"Introduction to Sociology","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"442","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"Sociology and Anthropology","SHORTDESC":"n\/a","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Spring 2020","RNO":"351","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"1423","ABBR":"PHYS 473","TITLE":"Introduction to Solid State Physics","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"421","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"Physics","SHORTDESC":"In this course, students learn the basic notions of solid-state  physics such as: periodic crystal lattices, phonons, Bloch theorem, properties of electronic bands in metals, semiconductors and insulators, conduction properties of various materials, the notion of Fermi-surface in metals, and magnetic phase transitions.","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Fall 2019","RNO":"352","PREREQ":"PHYS 280 Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics (1179) (C- and above) AND PHYS 451 Quantum Mechanics I (1415) (C- and above)","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"2178","ABBR":"WLL 209","TITLE":"Introduction to Translation Studies","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"521","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"Languages, Literature and Linguistics","SHORTDESC":"This course will introduce the students to theoretical and practical issues in modern translation studies and provide elementary training in the practice of translation and interpreting.","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Fall 2020","RNO":"353","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"142","ABBR":"HST 110\/REL 110","TITLE":"Introduction to World Religions","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"442","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"History, Philosophy and Religious Studies, History, Philosophy and Religious Studies","SHORTDESC":"This course offers an introduction to the major religious traditions in the world.","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Spring 2020","RNO":"354","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"1030","ABBR":"WLL 213\/SPA 211","TITLE":"Introduction to the Hispanic World","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"521","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"Languages, Literature and Linguistics, Languages, Literature and Linguistics","SHORTDESC":"n\/a","ACADEMICLEVEL":"Undergraduate","ACADEMICLEVELID":"1","BREADTH":"n\/a","CCDISPLAY":"1","TERMNAME":"Fall 2020","RNO":"355","PREREQ":"","COREQ":"","ANTIREQ":""},{"COURSEID":"3000","ABBR":"HST 124","TITLE":"Introduction to the History of Medicine","CRUS":"3","CRECTS":"6","LASTTAUGHT":"421","SCHOOL":"School of Sciences and Humanities","SCHOOLABBR":"SSH","SCHOOLID":"12","DEPARTMENT":"History, Philosophy and Religious Studies","SHORTDESC":"This course surveys the most important developments, issues, accomplishments and problems in the history of medicine from the beginnings of human civilization to the present.

The basic concepts of pharmacology, such as drug testing and approval, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, pharmaco-therapeutics and toxic effects, dosage calculations, and challenges related to drug therapy, provide the foundation from which drug therapy associated with specific body systems can be addressed. Discussion of the major drug groups focuses on therapeutic actions and indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, contraindications and precautions, adverse effects, clinically important drug-drug interactions and nursing implications which emphasize the nursing process and focus on patient care and education. Prototypes of the major drug groups are emphasized.
