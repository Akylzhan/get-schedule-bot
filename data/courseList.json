Various types of surface forces and their origin will be discussed from the point of view of the Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey and Overbeek theory and more modern theoretical models. Techniques for measuring of surface forces will be presented. Wetting and spreading phenomena, concepts for contact angles and spreading coefficients will be discussed, along with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Methods for preparation of colloids based on dispersion and condensation techniques will be presented and discussed with examples of various colloids. Characterization of the surface charge and the size distribution of colloidal particles. Electrokinetic mobility and Zeta-potential will also be considered. Several classes of colloids of industrial importance will be studied in detail, like suspension, emulsions and foams.

It is structured around three core integrated subject areas: Academic Critical Literacy; Academic Listening and Speaking; Academic Reading and Writing. These core areas are linked thematically to the various content areas that the students pursue in semester 2. All students complete a research project which is firmly situated in their chosen pathway and acts as the focal point for developing the following skills: recognizing bias, assumptions and arguments in sources; writing in academic format and language. Critical academic thinking and analysis in reading texts and writing essays are taught with the aim of allowing students to become competent in academic discourse. The research project is continually assessed throughout the semester and includes three, way stages where grades are awarded. The research project is then defended in a viva examination. The viva aims to produce the following learning outcomes; Delivery of a confident and competent presentation; Effective communication in varied oral exchanges; Effective expression in a specified formal context. Developing the skills necessary to scaffold the viva is ongoing throughout the semester and culminates in an intensive two-week period of preparation after the research project has been submitted. There are two further components of assessment in semester 2: (1) an open book reading examination and (2) a listening and note-taking assessment.  The open book reading examination revisits many of the skills developed during research project preparation.
